# Virtue DAO EnDAOments

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with no proposals. The Virtue DAO creates a virtuous swarm aligned with the mission. Members receive continuous EnDAOment funding based on their virtue.

## The Problem With DAO Proposals

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) help us fulfill a common purpose, allocate resources and coordinate activities.

**But** proposals take a long time to write, read and vote on. Voter turnout is often very low. Waiting for permission for proposals is not fast enough in fast moving scenarios or in large communities with lots of localized expertise and decisions. Proposals are not in the spirit of permissionless action and do-ocracy. 

## Virtuous Swarms With No Proposals

As a metaphor, consider a monastic order where individuals gain access to the resources of the order based on their adherence to following the precepts of their order - through their virtue. If the people of the order (monks, knights, artists, activists) remain true to the precepts others who are inspired by their actions and way of acting donate to the endowment.

Here are some example virtues, drawn from Agile Software Development, the Open Source ethos, Buddhist precepts and the code of chivalry: 
* Writes open source DAO governance code that is useful to the community
* Acts to support the welfare of other DAO members
* Abstains from false speech
* Perseveres to the end in any enterprise begun

To get more utilitarian, many organizations have a mission, stated values and KPIs. These can be translated into "virtues".

## How It Works

## Initial Idea Bucket

* Resource allocation without proposals 
* Funds allocated and made available proportionate to how much a person embodies the virtues that the DAO values
* Funded with DAO grants and compound interest from loaning out deposits using compound (like a coop bank or endowment)
* Paid with a continuous stipend and access for the virtuous with a sustainable distribution of funds - to maintain continuity of virtue incentives
* Blockchain anchored reputation verifying who has virtues that support the values and mission of the DAO
* Monthly allocation of resources with the option to pool resources
* A fair method of sourcing virtue from DAO members or a third party like Kleros
* We will probably build on existing DAO codebase like *DAOStack*
