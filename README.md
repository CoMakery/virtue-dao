# Virtue DAO

## Why Virtuous Swarms With No Proposals

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) help us fulfill a common purpose, allocate resources and coordinate activities.

**But** proposals take a long time to write, read and vote on. Voter turnout is often very low. Waiting for permission for proposals is not fast enough in fast moving scenarios or exploding complexity with lots of localized expertise. Proposals are not in the spirit of permissionless action and do-ocracy. 

## How It Could Work 

As a metaphor, consider a monastic order where individuals gain access to the resources of the order based on their adherence to following the precepts of their order - through their virtue. If the people of the order (monks, knights, artists, activists) remain true to the precepts others who are inspired by their actions and way of acting donate to the endowment.

Here's the rough starting point for the implementation:

* Resource allocation without proposals 
* Funds allocated and made available proportionate to how much a person embodies the virtues that the DAO values
* Funded with DAO grants and compound interest from loaning out deposits using compound (like a coop bank or endowment)
* Paid with a continuous stipend and access for the virtuous with a sustainable distribution of funds - to maintain continuity of virtue incentives
* Blockchain anchored reputation verifying who has virtues that support the values and mission of the DAO
* Monthly allocation of resources with the option to pool resources
* A fair method of sourcing virtue from DAO members or a third party like Kleros
* We will probably build on existing DAO codebase like *DAOStack*

## Who We Need On The Team

* UI/UX Designers - design matters for communicating this idea.
* Developers - Solidity, Javascript.
* Advisors who are interested in the approach or have knowledge about foundations, endowments, and community organization. Pleae join us to help develop the use cases.

## Communication

* Tell me you are interested by responding to this Github task
* Message me on Telegram @noahthorp
* We will setup team chat once the team starts to form (probably telegram)
